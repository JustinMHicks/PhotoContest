			<p>The Cloisters, a branch of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, is America's only museum dedicated exclusively to the art of the Middle Ages. Picturesquely overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Tryon Park in northern Manhattan, the Museum derives its name from the portions of five medieval cloisters incorporated into a modern museum structure. Not replicating any one particular medieval building type or setting, but rather designed to evoke the architecture of the later Middle Ages, The Cloisters creates an integrated and harmonious context in which visitors can experience the rich tradition of medieval artistic production, including metalwork, painting, sculpture, and textiles. By definition, a cloister consists of a covered walkway surrounding a large open courtyard providing access to other monastic buildings. Similarly, the museum's cloisters act as passageways to galleries; and they provide as inviting a place for rest and contemplation for visitors as they often did in their original monastic settings.</p>
			<p>Any history of The Cloisters must begin with George Grey Barnard (1863-1938). A student of Rodin, Barnard was a prominent American sculptor. While working in rural France, Barnard supplemented his income by locating and selling medieval sculpture and architectural fragments that had made their way into the hands of local landowners over several centuries of political and religious upheaval. A romantic figure, Barnard viewed himself as a modern-day adventurer embellishing the stories of his many finds with tall tales of discovery.</p>

			<p>Riverbank is the only park of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Inspired by urban rooftop designs in Japan, this 28-acre multi-level landscaped recreational facility is a state-of-the-art park facility. Rising 69 feet above the Hudson River, Riverbank offers a wide variety of recreational, athletic and arts experiences for all ages, interests and abilities.Housed in five major buildings are an Olympic-size pool, a covered skating rink for roller skating in the summer and ice-skating in the winter, an 800-seat cultural theater, a 2,500-seat athletic complex with fitness room, and a 150-seat restaurant.Outdoor sports amenities include a 25-yard lap pool, a wading pool, four tennis courts, four basketball courts, a softball field, four hand/paddleball courts, and a 400-meter eight-lane running track with a football/soccer field.Riverbank also boasts spectacular promenade views of the Hudson River, the Palisades and the George Washington Bridge. At water level, there is a 400-seat amphitheater and docking facilities for excursion and fishing boats.</p>

			<p>In the late 1600s the land that is now Juan Pablo Duarte Square was developed as a farm by Trinity Church. A forty-foot-wide canal was built to the south in 1810 to drain the pestilent Collect Pond into the Hudson River. The canal was filled in 1819 and now forms Canal Street. As the city spread northward, this became an important commercial thoroughfare. Canal Street achieved further prominence with the construction of the Holland Tunnel at its western end in 1927.Juan Pablo Duarte Square was officially dedicated in 1945, when Sixth Avenue was renamed Avenue of the Americas in celebration of Pan-American unity. The name of the square, located near the southern end of the Avenue of the Americas, honors Juan Pablo Duarte (1813-1876), the liberator of the Dominican Republic. As a young man, Duarte founded a society called La Trinitaria which sought to promote democratic ideals among the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Hispaniola Island, most of whom were clustered around the city of Santo Domingo. In 1843 Duarte launched an attempt to free the eastern half of the island from Haitian rule. When the rebellion failed, Duarte fled Hispaniola. However, when a new revolution succeeded in winning independence for the Dominican Republic in February 1844, Duarte was invited to return as President of the new republic. Although he eventually lost control to a military dictator and died in exile, Duarte was instrumental in developing the Pan-American traditions of democracy and self-government celebrated by the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
			<p>Duarte Square, a triangular plot bounded by Sullivan Street, Grand Street, and the Avenue of the Americas at the intersection with Canal Street, was initially developed and maintained by the Department of Transportation. The square was improved in 1975 with the addition of benches, trees, and sidewalks.On May 26, 1977, Duarte Square was transferred to the Department of Parks. A statue of Juan Pablo Duarte, donated by the Consulate of the Dominican Republic, was dedicated in the square on the 165th anniversary of Duarte’s birth, January 26, 1978. The thirteen-foot bronze figure, which rests atop an eight-foot granite base, was designed by the Italian sculptor Nicola Arrighini. It is one of a pantheon of six monuments to Latin American leaders which overlook the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Harriet+Tubman+Memorial+Plaza,+2269+Frederick+Douglass+Blvd/@40.8081859,-73.9528262,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c2f613701b7baf:0x1eb7bd0c61caca39"><li>Harriet Tubman Memorial Plaza</li></a>
			<p>This larger-than-life bronze sculpture depicts abolitionist organizer and Underground Railroad leader Harriet Tubman (c. 1822-1913), and stands at the crossroads of St. Nicholas Avenue, West 122nd Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem. Douglass once said of Tubman that except for John Brown, he knew of "no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people."Born into slavery in Maryland around 1822, Tubman escaped in 1849 via the Underground Railroad, the network of places and people dedicated to helping slaves find their way to freedom in non-slaveholding communities. Settling first in Philadelphia, then Canada, Tubman spent ten years returning to Maryland at great personal risk, to guide scores of friends and family members to freedom. Determined to end slavery, she later served the Union Army as a scout, spy and nurse in the Civil War. Settling in Auburn, New York after the war, she continued campaigning for equal rights for women and African-Americans. Her humanitarian work, including caring for the sick, homeless and disabled of all races, resulted in the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged in that community. She died in 1913 and was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn with semi-military honors.</p>
			<p>The memorial, commissioned through the Department of Cultural Affairs' Percent for Art program, was created by African-American sculptor Alison Saar. The artist has depicted Tubman "not as the conductor of the Underground Railroad but as the train itself, an unstoppable locomotive,” the roots of slavery pulled up in her wake. Saar designed stylized portraits of "anonymous passengers" of the Underground Railroad in Tubman's skirt, some of which were inspired by West African "passport masks." Around the granite base of the monument are bronze tiles alternately depicting events in Tubman's life and traditional quilting patterns.The $2.8 million, multi-agency project, which included the landscaping of a formerly barren traffic triangle, was sponsored by former Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields. Designed by Quennell Rothschild and constructed by URS, the renovated triangle features paving blocks and roughly hewn granite to create a natural setting. Plantings native to both New York and Tubman's home state of Maryland represent the woods and terrain traveled by Tubman and her Underground Railroad passengers, providing a contemplative space in which to consider Tubman's legacy.</p>

			<p>A marsh, then a cemetery, afterwards a parade ground, and finally a gathering place for avant-garde artists, chess players, and NYU students, Washington Square Park has served various roles for its community throughout the years.  It is  especially well-known for its arch, honoring George Washington, the man for whom the park is named, and its fountain.  Most of the buildings you will see surrounding the park are owned and operated by New York University.</p>
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Union+Square+Park/@40.7362512,-73.9903086,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x2a5c7f9eea6938a0"><li>Union Square Park</li></a>
			<p>Union Square wasn’t named after the Union Army, or even the unity of the states.  Instead, it gets it’s title from being the unifying intersection for the two most popular roadways in Manhattan: Broadway and Bowery (or at least where Bowery used to lie). Take a look around and you might notice a lot of significant characters from your American history textbook including George Washington on horseback, Abraham Lincoln, and the Marquis De Lafayette.  Make sure not to miss Ghandi in the Southwest corner of the square either!  The Square has an interesting history itself even without the historical figures to aid it.  It’s known as a common area for political rallies and demonstrations and in the months following September 11, 2001, it was the site of many vigils for victims of terrorism. Finally, be sure to take notice of the metronome and clock on the south end of the square.</p>
			<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Madison+Square+Park/@40.742037,-73.987564,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c259a6bd917da7:0x79997d3983197d7c"><li>Madison Square Park</li></a>
			<p>Madison Square Park is named for James Madison, 4th President of the United States and one of the principal authors of the constitution.  However, before this became an illustrious New York location, the US Army ran drills and artillery exercises here and later housed juvenile delinquents on the site.  In 1842, one of the first baseball teams - The New York Knickerbocker Base Ball Club - practiced where you now stand.  When the park was being developed and finally opened in 1847, the team relocated to Hoboken.</p>
			<p>From your position, you should be able to spot two iconic buildings: The Met Life Tower and the New York Life Building.  The Met Life Tower was built in 1909 and was the world’s tallest building for 3 years before it was surpassed in height by the Woolworth department store.  The iconic skyscraper is now being repurposed as a hotel.  The New York Life Insurance building is also notable with it’s gleaming, golden gilded spire despite it’s status as the 86th tallest building in NYC. (The tallest being the World Trade Center.)  Completed in 1928, New York Life Insurance Company still calls this home.</p>

			<p>Once the site of many a tavern complete with house of ill-repute nearby, the area where Fulton Street meets the East River was one of the largest commercial seaports in America from about 1820 - 1860.  After the commercial traffic into the port slowed down, the neighborhood fell into disrepair and lay crumbling until the 1960s and 70s when private donors began buying the historic properties, renovating them, and repurposing them as attractions and historical landmarks.  The ships you see moored nearby represent one of the largest private fleets in the country, and several of the boats were constructed before 1900.  Can you guess which one is the oldest?  It is The Wavertree, built in 1885 in England and carries the distinction of being the largest iron sailing vessel still afloat.</p>
			<p>If you have time, find the restaurant and tavern named The Bridge, which claims to be the oldest standing bar in Manhattan.  Plus, just 2 doors down from it stands a building that once held contests to see how many rats a rat-terrier could kill in a single day.</p>

			<p>Trinity Church is the Episcopal Dioceses of New York, meaning that it controls all other Episcopal churches in the city.  The parish of Trinity Church was chartered in 1697 by King William III (remember, America had not declared independence until 1776) for the absurd price of 60 bushels of wheat.  However, the structure you see standing before you today was erected in 1846 after the first two parishes were demolished due to fire and shoddy workmanship.  Due to a grant of about 62 acres of Manhattan land in 1705 by Queen Anne, Trinity Church owns quite a bit of real estate in lower Manhattan and pulls in around 38 million in profit every year from its assets.  Probably most notable about Trinity are the people buried within its gates.  Entombed in the graveyard are notable revolutionaries including Alexander Hamilton, William Bradford, and Robert Fulton.</p>

			<p>Brookfield Place (until very recently known as the World Financial Center) is a group of 6 buildings that house the main operations of Merril Lynch, RBC, and American Express among others. Ironically enough, these tall glass and steel monoliths were built in the 1980s atop a pile of garbage.  To support the structures, developers brought in tons of dirt and garbage to fill the ground beneath the pavement you are standing upon right now.  After sustaining significant damages from the debris following the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in 2001, renovations were completed and plans were made to expand the complex to include several luxury retail stores and an European style marketplace and restaurant.</p>

			<p> After the stock market crash of 1987, a local New York artist Arturo Di Modica created the Bull sculpture.  During the night of December 15, 1989, without authorization from city officials, Arturo Di Modica installed this sculpture in the middle of Broad Street, outside the New York Stock Exchange, beneath a 60 foot Christmas Tree.  This was the one time that a bull was not welcome on Wall Street, and it was removed by the city the next day.  Following a public outcry, the Bull was brought back into Manhattan, but moved to just north of Bowling Green Park (near 26 Broadway). This spot eventually became its permanent home.  Today, visitors acquire luck from the bull by rubbing his horns, nose, and um...more delicate parts.</p>
			<p>The bull represents financial virility and when stocks as a whole are increasing in value, it is said to be a bull market.  Conversely, the term used to describe a downward trend in the overall economy is a bear market.  Most of the financial success in New York is generated by a FIRE economy (an acronym that stands for Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate).</p>
