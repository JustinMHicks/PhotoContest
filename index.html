			<p>Perhaps nowhere in New York quite captures the sheer opulence of its 19th century robber barons as the Cloisters. This opulence is manifested not by what is there, but rather from what isn’t. Look across the Hudson and you see the great forested cliffs of the New Jersey Palisades. These cliffs are devoid of development because J.P. Morgan and J.D. Rockefeller bought up the many aristocratic estates that lined this part of the river and planted forests to give the view from the Cloisters, the Met’s medieval wing, a convincingly Middle Ages air. The building itself was assembled by Rockefeller money in the 20’s and 30’s. The family paid for the relocation and reassembly of five different Spanish and French medieval buildings. If you look at the building itself, you can tell that it’s really just a bunch of different architectural elements put together.</p>

			<p>In the late 1600s the land that is now Juan Pablo Duarte Square was developed as a farm by Trinity Church. A forty-foot-wide canal was built to the south in 1810 to drain the pestilent Collect Pond into the Hudson River. The canal was filled in 1819 and now forms Canal Street. As the city spread northward, this became an important commercial thoroughfare. Canal Street achieved further prominence with the construction of the Holland Tunnel at its western end in 1927.Juan Pablo Duarte Square was officially dedicated in 1945, when Sixth Avenue was renamed Avenue of the Americas in celebration of Pan-American unity. The name of the square, located near the southern end of the Avenue of the Americas, honors Juan Pablo Duarte (1813-1876), the liberator of the Dominican Republic. As a young man, Duarte founded a society called La Trinitaria which sought to promote democratic ideals among the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of Hispaniola Island, most of whom were clustered around the city of Santo Domingo. In 1843 Duarte launched an attempt to free the eastern half of the island from Haitian rule. When the rebellion failed, Duarte fled Hispaniola. However, when a new revolution succeeded in winning independence for the Dominican Republic in February 1844, Duarte was invited to return as President of the new republic. Although he eventually lost control to a military dictator and died in exile, Duarte was instrumental in developing the Pan-American traditions of democracy and self-government celebrated by the Avenue of the Americas.</p>
			<p>Duarte Square, a triangular plot bounded by Sullivan Street, Grand Street, and the Avenue of the Americas at the intersection with Canal Street, was initially developed and maintained by the Department of Transportation. The square was improved in 1975 with the addition of benches, trees, and sidewalks.On May 26, 1977, Duarte Square was transferred to the Department of Parks. A statue of Juan Pablo Duarte, donated by the Consulate of the Dominican Republic, was dedicated in the square on the 165th anniversary of Duarte’s birth, January 26, 1978. The thirteen-foot bronze figure, which rests atop an eight-foot granite base, was designed by the Italian sculptor Nicola Arrighini. It is one of a pantheon of six monuments to Latin American leaders which overlook the Avenue of the Americas.</p>

			<p>This larger-than-life bronze sculpture depicts abolitionist organizer and Underground Railroad leader Harriet Tubman (c. 1822-1913), and stands at the crossroads of St. Nicholas Avenue, West 122nd Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem. Douglass once said of Tubman that except for John Brown, he knew of "no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people."Born into slavery in Maryland around 1822, Tubman escaped in 1849 via the Underground Railroad, the network of places and people dedicated to helping slaves find their way to freedom in non-slaveholding communities. Settling first in Philadelphia, then Canada, Tubman spent ten years returning to Maryland at great personal risk, to guide scores of friends and family members to freedom. Determined to end slavery, she later served the Union Army as a scout, spy and nurse in the Civil War. Settling in Auburn, New York after the war, she continued campaigning for equal rights for women and African-Americans. Her humanitarian work, including caring for the sick, homeless and disabled of all races, resulted in the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged in that community. She died in 1913 and was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn with semi-military honors.</p>
			<p>The memorial, commissioned through the Department of Cultural Affairs' Percent for Art program, was created by African-American sculptor Alison Saar. The artist has depicted Tubman "not as the conductor of the Underground Railroad but as the train itself, an unstoppable locomotive,” the roots of slavery pulled up in her wake. Saar designed stylized portraits of "anonymous passengers" of the Underground Railroad in Tubman's skirt, some of which were inspired by West African "passport masks." Around the granite base of the monument are bronze tiles alternately depicting events in Tubman's life and traditional quilting patterns.The $2.8 million, multi-agency project, which included the landscaping of a formerly barren traffic triangle, was sponsored by former Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields. Designed by Quennell Rothschild and constructed by URS, the renovated triangle features paving blocks and roughly hewn granite to create a natural setting. Plantings native to both New York and Tubman's home state of Maryland represent the woods and terrain traveled by Tubman and her Underground Railroad passengers, providing a contemplative space in which to consider Tubman's legacy.</p>

         	<p>The Malcom Shabazz Mosque was founded in 1956 by Honorable Elijah Muhammad also known as Malcom X. The mosque is located at 102 west 116th street in Harlem. It was originally known as Muahammed’s Temple of Islam #7. At this time the mosque was being lead by Minister Malcom X and Minister Louis Farrakhan. While the Mosque was under Malcom X leadership change began to occur in the Islamic community. Latinos and African Americans saw the Mosque as an invitation to convert to Islam. The mosque had many supports such as Muhammad Ali, Singer Joe Tex,  The Delphonics and more. This helped the Mosque and the Islamic Faith receive an even bigger name. On Febuary 21, 1965 devastating news stuck the mosque when it was bombed by people who believed that the nation of Islam was the people who were responsible for the death of Malcom X. Most of the building burned down except Malcom X’s office building which is apart of the new building today. After the death of Malcom his son (Iman W.D Muhammed) decided to take over his teachings and lead the Mosque. In 1976 Iman W.D Muhammed renamed the mosque as Masjid Malcom Shabazz  in Honor of Malcom X.</p>

         	<p>City College was originally known as the Free Academy of the City of New York. It was founded in 1847 by Townsend Harris, then the president of the Board of Education. The goal for the school was to provide children from low-income homes an opportunity to get a higher education for free. The academy later was renamed The College of the City of New York in 1866. The name of the college continued to change until finally became City College for the University of New York. The school was originally located in downtown Manhattan from 1849 to 1907. The design for the building was created by James Renwick Jr. The building didn’t last for long; it was destroyed in 1928 and was replaced in 1930. The college was then moved to Manhattanville in 1906. The designer of the new neo-gothic campus was George Browne Post. The neo-gothic style is derived from the original gothic architectural style and includes distinctive decorative patterns, finials, scalloping, lancet windows, hood moldings, and label stops. The gothic style of architecture is presented in the Shepard Hall, Baskerville Hall, Compton Hall, Harris Hall, Wingate Hall. Although the college started of being free, it isn’t free anymore. However, there are many scholarship opportunities available.</p>

         		<p>The largest village in pre-colonial New York was located on the plain below Inwood Hill. Perhaps several thousand ethnic Algonquins (specifically Wiechquaegecks or “Wappingers”) lived in a village located at the present site of 204th Street and Seaman Avenue. Human burials have been discovered in the area, and the only complete Indian pot ever to excavated in Manhattan was taken out of the ground at 204th and Tenth. The caves in the park were inhabited and used as summer fishing and oystering camps long before the intensive Algonquin settlement of the neighborhood, which occurred as early as the first human settlement of the region 10,000 years ago. Inwood Hill Park is the last untouched forest on the island of Manhattan; watch out for snakes in the rocks!</p>

         	<p>Without a pump to give it pressure, water from an aqueduct will only rise as high as its source’s elevation. In pre-electric New York, this meant no water could rise past the sixth story of most buildings. The solution: water towers. Water pressure for upper floors was provided by water towers such as this one, built in 1872. Now defunct, this tower stands as a memory of one of New York’s boldest engineering projects to date. Water from the Croton Reservoir upstate passed through the High Bridge Aqueduct, the city’s oldest bridge, and traveled down Manhattan to the main reservoir that once stood at Bryant Park.</p>

			<p>If you want an idea of what Park Avenue, formerly Fourth Avenue, was like before the rail tunnels that run under it were fully enclosed, look no further than Brooklyn’s Atlantic Avenue. Today, the Long Island Rail Road runs in deep cuts or on elevateds for much of the length of of the avenue. The presence of the rail has made the area undesirable for residential development. Atlantic cuts a desolate, industrial path through the residential heart of north Brooklyn. Before Park Avenue was covered and steam engines and heavy rail traffic still made their presence felt, smelt, and heard, the Upper East Side quite separated from the rest of the city. When the tunnel was built, everything changed and Park Avenue became among the wealthiest places on Earth. The high rise at 740 Park Avenue has the most billionaires of any apartment building in the country.</p>

			<p>In the 1790’s, this part of the Upper East Side was a bit like what the Hamptons is today--an exurban beachfront lined with the weekend homes of the wealthy. The Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the mayors of New York since 1942, is the last remaining home of this kind and one of the oldest wooden structures on Manhattan. The park celebrates Carl Schurz, a German revolutionary from the botched German Unification of 1848 who fled to America and later became a U.S. Senator.</p>

			<p>Mount Sinai Hospital was founded in 1852 to address the health problems of the rapidly growing Jewish immigrant population in New York City.  Originally named "The Jews' Hospital", the founding location was built on 28th Street between 7th and 8th avenue.  As medical needs increased for the entire population of New York, the hospital changed it's name to Mount Sinai to reflect it's Jewish heritage, yet become more inviting to members of other religious groups.  Mount Sinai Hospital has a long list of accomplishments including being the site of the first liver transplant and pioneered using genetically engineered vaccines to treat the flu.  Among the distinguished students and doctors that have passed through these halls are our very own Sameer Kahn and Nadav Nahumi.</p>

			<p>Weill Cornell Medical College was founded on April 14, 1898 by Oliver H. Payne. In 1998 the college partnered with Presbyterian Hospital and was renamed The New York Presbyterian Hospital. Despite this merger, the teachings of Weill Cornell are preserved in the New York Presbyterian Hospital. It has 24 basic science and patient care programs available and provides an educational program that focuses on patient-care. Thus, the merger of Weill Cornell and Presbyterian Hospital helped strengthen the academic programs that the schools provide. In 2004 the Weill Cornell medical school opened the first American Medical school outside of United States Border in Qatar.</p>

The first institution in the United States devoted solely to using biomedical research to understand the underlying causes of disease, Rockefeller is today one of the foremost biomedical research centers in the world, and its scientists have made numerous seminal contributions to biology and medicine. Over the years, 24 scientists associated with the university have received Nobel Prizes and 21 have earned the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award. Fourteen Rockefeller scientists have received the Gairdner Foundation International Award and 14 have been given theNational Medal of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor. In addition to a century of prize-winning breakthroughs, Rockefeller has devoted over half a century to training the next generation of innovative, pathbreaking scientists.</p>

			<p>Roosevelt Island lies between Manhattan and Queens in the middle of the East River.  It gets it's name not from Theodore Roosevelt (the war-hero, conservationist President) but instead from Franklin D. Roosevelt (the President who instituted the New Deal following the Great Depression).  Make sure to see the Jacob Blackwell House built in 1796 when the island was privately owned.  It is one of the oldest surviving structures in New York City.  In 1828, Blackwell sold his island to the city of New York and within the next decade, the city opened a penitentiary and lunatic asylum on the land.  Soon after, the city would again house undesirable citizens when the Smallpox Hospital was opened in 1856.  Due to this reputation the island was named Welfare Island in 1921 (this was obviously before political correctness).</p>
			<p>In the 1970s, the island was renamed Roosevelt Island to signify a shift in the way New Yorkers have perceived the land and it's inhabitants in the last 50 years.  A tramway over the East River for the cost of a subway ride (prominently featured in the Spiderman films), high-rise luxury condominiums, a free bus service, and a recently completed park on the southern tip makes the island an attractive place to call home.  </p>

			<p>This flagship building for the New York Public Library is also a landmark in Midtown Manhattan. The building is made out of marble that is 3ft thick and is guarded by two iconic stone lions made of Tennessee marble.  The two lions, named "Patience" and "Fortitude" were sculpted by a man named Edward Clark Potter. The goal for the library was to have a develop an efficient system that would allow people who want books to receive them as soon as possible. The library was enlarged by 125,000 square feet in the 1980’s due to the growth of the research collection. To this day, the history and architecture of the building has caused it to be featured in many movies and pieces of literature.  If you have time, check out the fabled reading room located on one of the upper floors of the library - but be sure to turn off all cell phones and speak quietly so as not to disturb the patrons studying within! </p>

			<p>Tudor City was the first residential skyscraper in the world developed by Fred French in 1932.  Previously, First Avenue in the Upper East Side was a gang-ridden Irish community and a haven for criminals that earned the name "Corcoran's Roost" from Jimmy Corcoran, founder of the Rag Gang.  In an effort to clean up the neighborhood, residents transformed the grounds into a miniature 18-hole golf course, and tennis courts that were flooded and frozen in the winter to be re-purposed as skating rinks.  Tudor City gets it's name from the neo-Gothic architecture and embellishments that adorn the building.  While you're here, look across First Avenue and check out the United Nations building!</p>
			<li>Park Avenue</li>
			<p>Park Avenue is one of the most famous boulevards in Manhattan. The Avenue wasn’t always known as Park Avenue; it was originally named Fourth Avenue. During this time the Avenue was used to carry the railroads of New york and Harlem. As New York City was developed, part of the Avenue soon became known as "Park Avenue" due to the park like features and in 1956 all of Fourth Avenue became known as Park Avenue. Park Avenue is known to have one of the most expensive real estate and the area is home to many CEO’s from the large companies in New York. Although the Park isn’t neccesarily a major attraction, it is one of the most attractive boulevards with flowers planted along the median of the boulevard. Park Avenue has some amazing architectural designs that will be apparent as you stroll down the sidewalk. For instance, The Seventh regiment has Medieval architectural design that catches people’s attention.</p>

			<p>Go to any major commercial city and you’ll see them--reflecting the the blue of the sky or casting a second sun in amongst a skyline. The late twentieth century was the age of the all-glass skyscraper. The second one ever built graces the corner of 53rd and Park (the first is the Secretariat building of the UN). The former US headquarters of the Lever Brothers soap company, the lobby of Lever House is now an art gallery. While it looks contemporary, the Lever House was a shining new experiment in a still old-fashioned world. Think about this: the fifty year old employees who worked in the building could have remembered a New York before Grand Central Terminal and a time when the entire borough of Queens had a population half that of Harlem in 2014.</p>

			<p>In 1854, New Yorkers banned steam engines from going south of 42nd street, which was then the edge of town. To get further downtown, engines would detach and the cars would be pulled downtown by horses to a terminal at 27th Street and from there to City Hall via Park Avenue, Fourth Avenue, and the Bowery. Through the Civil War period, Cornelius Vanderbilt and his New York Central bought up the three other rail companies that operated on the line, forming a rail empire that would make Vanderbilt among the most powerful men in America. A rail station called Grand Central Depot was first built at 42nd and Park in 1871 and was rebuilt into Grand Central Terminal in 1913. The original design called for a skylight instead of the famous painting of the constellations and foundational supports for an office building atop the station. </p>
			<p>In 1903, McKim, Meade and White, the most famous architectural firm in turn-of-the-century New York, produced this plan for Grand Central Terminal. Note the open rail yards north of the station--Park Avenue wasn’t fully enclosed until the new station was opened in 1913.</p>

			<p>Fronted by one of the most famous hotels in the world, the Plaza Hotel, Manhattan’s Grand Army Plaza (as opposed to Brooklyn’s, which is certainly this plaza’s grander younger brother) marks the southeastern extent of Central Park. The plaza is focused upon Augustus Saint-Gaudens striking gilt (yes, that’s real gold) equestrian statue of Union Civil War hero William Tecumseh Sherman. Saint-Gaudens was a prolific sculptor who dominated the New York art world at the turn of the twentieth century. The designer of several US coins from the period, Saint-Gaudens also designed the gold statue that sits atop the Municipal Building downtown and the golden Diana that once graced the top of the original Madison Square Garden (at Madison Square Park; where else?). The man celebrated, William Tecumseh Sherman, is widely considered to be one of the originators of modern “total war” because of his army’s decimation of the Georgian countryside during the last days of the Civil War. He is reviled as a war criminal in parts of the South.</p>

			<p>Once among the most popular tourist attractions in New York City, Grant’s Tomb is the final resting place of Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States. Nicknamed “Unconditional Surrender” Grant during the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant was widely credited with winning the war for the Union side. His scandal-beleaguered administration presided over America’s intensifying industrialization, a railroad building bonanza, and the addition of an amendment to the constitution (the fifteenth) which reads, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Grant’s face graces our $50 note to this day.</p>

         	<p>“Cathedral” comes from the Latin word for “chair” and can only apply to a church that is the principal church of a diocese--the seat, or “chair,” of the local bishop. By this definition, St. John the Divine is the largest cathedral in the world and is one of the top five largest church buildings in the world. Still under construction after more than 130 years, the cathedral boasts some of the strangest religious art in the city. One of the most peculiar is a wall of twenty sculptures, each representing the great personages of the twenty Christian centuries. The sculptures representing the twentieth century are full body Medieval style portraits of Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Susan B. Anthony, and Albert Einstein.</p>

			<p>The city acquired the area in 1822 to make the current site of Bryant Park into a graveyard for its unknown and homeless poor. In the 1840’s, this was the southern terminus of the Croton Aqueduct, which ended in a massive reservoir with fifty foot high walls. Adjacent to this was New York’s Crystal Palace, a grand all-glass structure built in 1851. One of the first glass structures ever built, the Crystal Palace was the centerpiece of an international industrial expo that brought over one million visitors to New York in 1853. One in twenty four Americans visited the Crystal Palace Exposition. Imagine today if 13 million people were to converge on this space! A renowned architectural wonder, the Crystal Palace was destroyed in a fire in 1858. The reservoir was replaced by the current library building in 1900.</p>

			<p>Central Park’s northernmost water body used to be the most inland extremity of a tidal estuary that cut in from the East River. It lies in the shadow of the North Woods’ famous Blockhouse, a fortification that dates to Revolutionary times. Today, the Meer is a popular fishing spot. Despite its popularity and isolation from other bodies of water, the Meer is suffering from an introduction of the Asian Northern Snakehead, an invasive fish species that has been decimating northeastern freshwater ecosystems since 2002.</p>

			<p>You might notice how the ground slopes down just north of City Hall Park. This land was once part of Collect Pond, New York City’s only source of freshwater until the opening of the Croton Aqueduct in the 1840’s. By the early 19th century, the pond had grown fetid from industrial discharge and was hastily filled in around 1813. In precolonial times, the Canarsee village of Werpoes lined the pond’s southern side. Either by coincidence or some unrecorded interethnic understanding, the site of Werpoes would become the now-famous African Burial Ground. From the 1640s to the 1790s, ten of thousands of New York’s African-Americans were given traditional burials on the Collect Pond’s shores. The site was discovered in 1991 during the construction of a federal office building. Today, this bizarre corner of the city is the center of the NYC government, a political entity which governs a larger populace than that of Switzerland.</p>

			<p>A marsh, then a cemetery, afterwards a parade ground, and finally a gathering place for avant-garde artists, chess players, and NYU students, Washington Square Park has served various roles for its community throughout the years.  It is  especially well-known for its arch, honoring George Washington, the man for whom the park is named, and its fountain.  Most of the buildings you will see surrounding the park are owned and operated by New York University.</p>

			<p>Union Square wasn’t named after the Union Army, or even the unity of the states.  Instead, it gets it’s title from being the unifying intersection for the two most popular roadways in Manhattan: Broadway and Bowery (or at least where Bowery used to lie). Take a look around and you might notice a lot of significant characters from your American history textbook including George Washington on horseback, Abraham Lincoln, and the Marquis De Lafayette.  Make sure not to miss Ghandi in the Southwest corner of the square either!  The Square has an interesting history itself even without the historical figures to aid it.  It’s known as a common area for political rallies and demonstrations and in the months following September 11, 2001, it was the site of many vigils for victims of terrorism. Finally, be sure to take notice of the metronome and clock on the south end of the square.</p>

			<p>Madison Square Park is named for James Madison, 4th President of the United States and one of the principal authors of the constitution.  However, before this became an illustrious New York location, the US Army ran drills and artillery exercises here and later housed juvenile delinquents on the site.  In 1842, one of the first baseball teams - The New York Knickerbocker Base Ball Club - practiced where you now stand.  When the park was being developed and finally opened in 1847, the team relocated to Hoboken.</p>
			<p>From your position, you should be able to spot two iconic buildings: The Met Life Tower and the New York Life Building.  The Met Life Tower was built in 1909 and was the world’s tallest building for 3 years before it was surpassed in height by the Woolworth department store.  The iconic skyscraper is now being repurposed as a hotel.  The New York Life Insurance building is also notable with it’s gleaming, golden gilded spire despite it’s status as the 86th tallest building in NYC. (The tallest being the World Trade Center.)  Completed in 1928, New York Life Insurance Company still calls this home.</p>

			<p>In 1641, at a woodside tavern on the wilderness track linking New Amsterdam with the farming village of Haarlem (at approximately 2nd Avenue in the 40s or 50s), a disturbed young ethnic Wappinger carried out a revenge killing of the tavern’s owner, long-time colonist and friend of the local Indians, Claes Swits. This event rippled through the young colony and bent the recently arrived director, Willem Kieft, on a plan to drive Greater New York’s Algonquin population from the region. Going against the opinions of the colonial council, Kieft ordered attacks on Wappinger camps in Jersey City (pictured) and right here, at Corlear’s Hook. In one of the worst massacres in the history of the city, over a hundred twenty people, refugees driven south by marauding bands of Mohawk warriors, were murdered in cold blood by Kieft’s troops. This event resolved the feuding Algonquin bands to unify against the Dutch colony. The united tribes forced the entire European and African population to retreat to fortified town of New Amsterdam, which then didn’t extend north of Wall Street.</p>

			<p>Once the site of many a tavern complete with house of ill-repute nearby, the area where Fulton Street meets the East River was one of the largest commercial seaports in America from about 1820 - 1860.  After the commercial traffic into the port slowed down, the neighborhood fell into disrepair and lay crumbling until the 1960s and 70s when private donors began buying the historic properties, renovating them, and repurposing them as attractions and historical landmarks.  The ships you see moored nearby represent one of the largest private fleets in the country, and several of the boats were constructed before 1900.  Can you guess which one is the oldest?  It is The Wavertree, built in 1885 in England and carries the distinction of being the largest iron sailing vessel still afloat.</p>
			<p>If you have time, find the restaurant and tavern named The Bridge, which claims to be the oldest standing bar in Manhattan.  Plus, just 2 doors down from it stands a building that once held contests to see how many rats a rat-terrier could kill in a single day.</p>

			<p>Trinity Church is the Episcopal Dioceses of New York, meaning that it controls all other Episcopal churches in the city.  The parish of Trinity Church was chartered in 1697 by King William III (remember, America had not declared independence until 1776) for the absurd price of 60 bushels of wheat.  However, the structure you see standing before you today was erected in 1846 after the first two parishes were demolished due to fire and shoddy workmanship.  Due to a grant of about 62 acres of Manhattan land in 1705 by Queen Anne, Trinity Church owns quite a bit of real estate in lower Manhattan and pulls in around 38 million in profit every year from its assets.  Probably most notable about Trinity are the people buried within its gates.  Entombed in the graveyard are notable revolutionaries including Alexander Hamilton, William Bradford, and Robert Fulton.</p>

			<p>Brookfield Place (until very recently known as the World Financial Center) is a group of 6 buildings that house the main operations of Merril Lynch, RBC, and American Express among others. Ironically enough, these tall glass and steel monoliths were built in the 1980s atop a pile of garbage.  To support the structures, developers brought in tons of dirt and garbage to fill the ground beneath the pavement you are standing upon right now.  After sustaining significant damages from the debris following the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in 2001, renovations were completed and plans were made to expand the complex to include several luxury retail stores and an European style marketplace and restaurant.</p>

			<p> After the stock market crash of 1987, a local New York artist Arturo Di Modica created the Bull sculpture.  During the night of December 15, 1989, without authorization from city officials, Arturo Di Modica installed this sculpture in the middle of Broad Street, outside the New York Stock Exchange, beneath a 60 foot Christmas Tree.  This was the one time that a bull was not welcome on Wall Street, and it was removed by the city the next day.  Following a public outcry, the Bull was brought back into Manhattan, but moved to just north of Bowling Green Park (near 26 Broadway). This spot eventually became its permanent home.  Today, visitors acquire luck from the bull by rubbing his horns, nose, and um...more delicate parts.</p>
			<p>The bull represents financial virility and when stocks as a whole are increasing in value, it is said to be a bull market.  Conversely, the term used to describe a downward trend in the overall economy is a bear market.  Most of the financial success in New York is generated by a FIRE economy (an acronym that stands for Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate).</p>
